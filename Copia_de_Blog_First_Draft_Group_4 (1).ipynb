        "This paper tries to develop a tool of multimodal estimation of the evolution of patients with cancer. A neural network is built to predict the survival of patients with 20 different types of cancer using data from:\n",
        "mRNA expression data, microRNA expression data and histopathology whole slide images (WSIs).\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors claim that the multimodality of the data makes it difficult for physicians to find patterns. The presence of information from many patients and many different types of cancer can be of advantage for machine learning to exploit similarities. Nevertheless, it is still a challenging task due to the heterogeneity and high dimensional nature of the available data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# ***Approach***\n",
        "\n",
        "The difficulty of this paper lays on the data. Reproduction requires downloading Terabytes of information in many different formats from databases that are updated regularly. Just getting around downloading, understanding and opening the data took the first 2 to 3 weeks of work. To not delay ourselves more learning how to manage all of it, we decided to start from the code provided by the authors as a base. Nevertheless, we found two big problems with it. Firstly, the code contains deprecated functions, calls for files of unknown origin, etc. Secondly, it carries out, in many cases, processes that don't relate to what the paper describes.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, with the limited amount of time and resources of this Reproducibility Project, we decided the following approach. We first fixed the code with slight modifications that helped us run it in the end. We then made efforts to understand the code as it was written, which turned out to be a difficut task. Then, we reported every process that is inconsistent with the description of the paper and suggest how it should be fixed. With this we hope to help the reader understand the process that the paper describes in a practical environment, since we found it very hard to follow from the paper. In the cases in which the paper provides insuficient information to write a proper code, we have reported it too."
